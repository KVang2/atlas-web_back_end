# Unittest and Intergration Tests

## Learning Objectives
- The difference between unit and integration tests is that unit tests take results from a single unit, the function call and integration tests results from various parts.
- Mocking is a process used in unit testing when the unit is being tested has external dependencies.
- parametrizations use for testing functions/ features that have simple input, when testing for a variety of input.
- Fixtures ensure test runs in a clean and controlled environment, avoiding code duplications, includes setting up objects, databases, and files.
