# Caching

## Learning objective
- Caching system, temporarily stores frequently accessed data to reduce time, taken to retrieve data from slower or more expensive storage location. Goal is to speed up data retrieval. 
- FIFO (First in, first out) first data that was added in will be the first to be removed out.
- LIFO (Last in, First out) Where the last item added is the first to be removed. 
- LRU (Least Recently Used) caching policy where least recently accessed data item is removed first. 
- MRU (Most Recently Used) caching policy that evicts most recently accesseed data item first. 
- LFU ( Least Frequently Used) a caching policy that removes the least accessed data first. 
- Purpose of a caching system is to improve performance and efficiency.
- Limits a caching system have are memory/ storage limitations, consistency issues, complexity in implementation and cache misses.
